# introduction

For several years now, images generated by artificial intelligence systems such as [midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/home?callbackUrl=%2Fexplore), [DALL·E](https://openai.com/dall-e-2) or [StableDiffusion](https://stability.ai), to give just a few examples, have become commonplace. Like text-generating systems such as [GPT](https://openai.com/gpt-4), [LLAMA](https://ai.meta.com/llama/) or [BLOOM](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloom), they are based on interaction with users, which results in the writing of prompts. The aim of our current research is to examine the various means at our disposal for transforming not only generated images and texts but also prompts into primary sources for historians. This short paper will focus on prompts.

## state of the art

In the fields of digital memory studies (@hoskinsDigitalMemoryStudies2018) and digital history, Wulf Kansteiner investigates what a specifically trained generative AI for historians could be (@kansteinerDigitalDopingHistorians2022) but without really looking at primary sources produced by these systems (the images and texts generated and the prompts used, in this case, by historians). The possibilities and risks of AI, particularly generative AI and especially in Holocaust studies, were analysed in an “open forum” of *Eastern European Holocaust Studies* (@makhortykhOpenForumPossibilities2023). In particular, the (low) adequacy of the responses of some of the generative AIs to Holocaust research was analysed in detail (@makhortykhGenerativeAIContestation2023). Online software can be tested to understand what generative AI systems “know” about history (@hutchinsonWhatAIsKnow). Changes -- positive or not -- in the memorialisation processes have also been analysed (@makhortykhShallAndroidsDream2023a), rather from the infrastructure angle. But as far as we know, there is little research on prompts as a source for history or for the study of collective memory. Those articles are also dealing with ethics, privacy and biases (including biased training dataset)[^extended]. Within a couple of years, the digital history and memory studies litterature on AI has hence and is still expanding. Nevertheless, and to our knowledge, few researchers have put prompts at the core of their research.

## what could we learn from prompts?

Questionning the past is the core activity of historians, their basic epistemological operation in the sense that we ask questions to start the process of elaborating new knowledge about the past. The fact that easy to use tools (image or text generative systems) are based on prompts, which are often explicit or implicit questions, should get our attention. Those systems are incentives to question our world and the world that was, all the more that, as “stochastic parrots” (@benderDangersStochasticParrots2021), they are a-epistemological: there is no notion of truth, lie or knowledge in the way those systems are working.

If we consider what those systems are based on (code, training dataset for instance), what is required to generate an answer (prompts) or their outputs (images, texts, etc.), then they are generating numerous primary sources -- artefacts that tells us a lot about the societies of the (near) past. One of those primary sources are prompts. We consider here prompts relating to the past as open doors to users' imagination about the past on one side, but also as a way to negotiate with the “machine” (when LLMs or image generative systems are not delivering what the user is expecting) on the other side.

# harvesting data

The first methodological barrier to a research project on prompts related to the past is the making of a corpus. Where to find prompts? There are several ways we could assemble a database of prompts. There are several paths that could be followed to constitute a sound corpus. A first path would be to use dedicated search engines, such as [Lexica](https://lexica.art/) (an example among others). Those search engines poses several problems: either they are basic keywords based search engine and collecting prompts would imply a database of past-related keywords or they are “semantic” (the case of lexica) and becomes hence black boxes. A further problem with those search engine is that, in our experience, have not kept a crucial metadata: date and time. 

A second path would be to directly do what those search engines are doing: collecting data on Discord, an instant messaging and VoIP social platform. Discord has indeed become a keypoint for communities to share their uses of large langguage models or image-generation systems. Companies such as [midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/home?callbackUrl=%2Fexplore) have even used [Discord as an interface to their system](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/midjourney-discord). Data can then be scrapped from discord public servers -- after consultation of an ethics review panel[^ethics] -- through a bot to respect Discord terms of use.

[^ethics]: The [D/ARC community](https://darcmode.org/) can offer insights on discord data scrapping that is compatible with the [AoIR Ethics Guidelines](https://aoir.org/reports/ethics3.pdf).

Harvesting this data is not, if we stick to technicalities, the harder part of the constitution of a corpus. The hardest part is to create a balanced corpus -- for instance, we can work with data that are not linked to sociodemographic metadata: in other word, we cannot investigate who we are studying -- on one side; to define what we mean by ”past” on the other side. Many cases are borderlines: generated images refering to afrofuturism, for insance, are also refering to the past. Should it be included in our database?

The lack of sociodemographic metadata could then be supplemented by a complementary qualitative approach, based on interviews with users of LLMs and image generative systems, to investigate their uses of those systems. Those interviews could also complete the prompts' data by enligthening us on how users are “negotiating“ with the “machine” to get what they expected from it. When the output is disapponting in their view, how do they modify their prompt?

# analyzing data

For now, we have collected data from a search engine, lexica.art, and will use our small datasets - to be seen as a test sample -- for our distant reading experiments. This small corpus is made of 1908 prompts, collected in March 2023 with the keyword 'european union' on lexica.art. We cose those passwords to see in which ways users are relating the European Uinon and Europe's historical past. We will try two kinds of distant reading on this corpus: topic modelling and word embeddings.

## distant reading prompts 

Here's a sort of topic modelling (not topic modelling but the assumes same function) of a corpus of 1908 prompts.

Iramuteq is basically clustering prompts based on collocations of words. The keywords you see are words that are the most representative of those clusters and allow for an interpretation of the clusters. There are other, thanks to this software, ways to help the user interpret the clustering (getting the most representative prompts of each clusters for instance).

The prompts here are containing 'european union' - I wanted other keywords for this presentation, but the scripts is not working anymore so I could not collect data specifically for this presentation.

- it's not only about the past, but quite a lot about
- there are clusters about styles -- note that a lot are 'historical' (soviet propaganda)
- there are elements of recent politics (nigel farage / marine) 
- europe as something linked to a period of time: Middel Age (heraldic) / 17th Century (Rembrandt)
- notions quite linked to european history: 'empire'
- the question of the link with news is quite important
- war is very present => because Europe, but it seems that there is a global association of history and war


If we stick to distant reading of prompts, we do not have the whole picture, and are missing what's happening between the users and the interface.


## oral history of prompting?

- the aim here of the user was to get a nazi salute -- and it's not working
  - think about the 'Napoléon rides a shark' image that you saw before: it's the same, it doesn't work
- It's not working for different reasons:
  - well, this system does not know what a nazi salute is -- images here are just pixels which succession is statistically pertinent
  - there might be limitations implemented in the text-to-image system (not likely with stable diffusion)

What does a user who did not get the results it wanted? 

- as it fails, users might have strategies to get what they want
  - strategy based on changing prompts, 
  - means that prompts, not only images (or generated text), are the result of the settings of the machine, or at least partly, and of a man-machine interaction.

## should we create our own prompt-generating-systems?

- we need prompts with proper metadata and that relate to the past 
    - one of the way to get that is to set up our own image / text generation system. With open source systems, it could be posisble.
    - we could train thoss system on 'historical data'.
    - many problems to solve -- including, of course ethics.

- we need to do scalable reading
   - but also to mix methods, not only DH but also (digital) sociology: interviews and surveys.

Here again, might cause ethical problems.
